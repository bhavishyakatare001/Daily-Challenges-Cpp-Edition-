# Daily C++ Challenge & DSA log 
> **"Consistency is the code that compiles success.**
## Overview 
This repository serves as a live documentation of my journey to mastering **Modern C++ ( C++ 17/20 )** , **Object-Oriented Design (ODD)** , and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

I use this space to solve practical engineering problems, refactor legacy logic, and implement design patterns from scratch.


## Tech Stack 

-**Language:**   C++ (Standard 17/20 Preferred)


-**Tools:**   GCC/Clang , Git , VS Code 


-**Focus Areas:** - Memory Management (Pointers, Smart Pointers) 
                  - Runtime Polymorphism & Virtual Tables 
                  - STL Containers & Algorithms
                  - System Design Basics 


## How to Run 
To Compile and run any specific challenge ( e.g payment_system.cpp ):

```bash
# Compile using g++

g++ -o output payment_system.cpp

# Run the executable (Windows)
./output.exe

# Run the executable (Linux / Mac)
./output
